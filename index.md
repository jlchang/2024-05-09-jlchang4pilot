### Quick show of hands:
How many students have used UNIX?<p>
How many students use Terminal on Mac? Powershell or "Windows Subsystem for Linux" on Windows? 

### What is the Unix "shell"?

The *shell* is a program that allows you to control your computer by typing instructions on the CLI with a keyboard.

### Why are we starting with Unix? (CLI)

* Most bioinformatics tools do not have graphical interfaces <figure>

* The command line allows you to automate and simplify tasks without learning a whole programmming language.

* Most "big data" work (cloud or "on-prem") requires the command line.
